# 🚀 **Welcome to Regrip**  

**Founded in 2021 by Tushar Suhalka, REGRIP India is on a mission to revolutionize the tyre industry by tackling pollution and fostering sustainability.** 🚀

🌍 Every year, over **1.5 billion tyres** are discarded worldwide, with only **20% being recycled**. Regrip aims to change this by building **cutting-edge platforms** for **tyre recycling, fleet management, and industry exchanges.**

We’re not just about innovation—we're about making a real impact. Whether it's **streamlining operations**, **enhancing efficiency**, or **driving industry transformation**, our goal is to simplify complexities and build a greener future. 🌱
